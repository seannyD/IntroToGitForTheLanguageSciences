<h1 id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we’ll learn how to collaborate on projects using git and GitHub.</p>
<p>To do this tutorial, you’ll need to be added as a collaborator on one of my GitHub projects. If you haven’t sent me your GitHub username, please email me.</p>
<h2 id="designing-projects-for-collaboration"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Designing projects for collaboration</h2>
<h3 id="file-structure"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> File structure</h3>
<p>It’s a good idea to have a very clear file structure for your project. This means that it’s easy to locate files, and it’s obvious where new files or changes should go.</p>
<p>I usually have something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Main folder (Top folder for the version control)</li>
<li>data
<ul>
<li>Raw data</li>
<li>Processed data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>processing (any scripts for processing raw data)
<ul>
<li>R</li>
<li>Python<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>analysis (any scripts for analysing results)
<ul>
<li>R</li>
</ul></li>
<li>results (for storing results)
<ul>
<li>graphs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>writeup (for storing drafts of articles)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reproducability"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Reproducability</h3>
<p>An ideal GitHub project will be completely self-sufficient and reproducible. That is, someone else should be able to download just the files that are in the repository, and reproduce all your results and output. To achieve this, consider</p>
<ul>
<li>Including all raw data inside the repository</li>
<li>Including all scripts that process the data and produce graphs/results</li>
<li>Using relative file paths in scripts. This means you should use paths like “../../data/RawData/Part1.csv”, rather than “C:/MyDocuments/Sean/LingProjects/data/RawData/Part1.csv”. This means that the scripts should run on somebody else’s computer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="documentation"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3</span> Documentation</h3>
<p>Documentation is important. It means having a “README” file for the project / each subflder, describing the contents of each file. If you include a file named “README.md” in the top directory of your repository, GitHub will use this as the project’s main page on the web. You should also document your code, describing what each function and set of lines does.</p>
<h2 id="collaboration-on-a-github-project"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Collaboration on a GitHub project</h2>
<p>I made a GitHub project here:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/seannyD/SeansGitHubTutorial-Collaboration" class="uri">https://github.com/seannyD/SeansGitHubTutorial-Collaboration</a></p>
<p>Go to this page and have a look at the files and folders. It’s a project for a timed list experiment. Participants have to list as many items from a semantic domain as possible. The responses are written to a file, one line per response. Like this:</p>
<pre>
cow
pig
sheep
salmon

</pre>
<p>The raw files can be found in the folder <a href="https://github.com/seannyD/SeansGitHubTutorial-Collaboration/tree/master/data/rawData/animals">data/rawData/animals</a>.</p>
<p>The name of the file is the participant name/id followed by an underscore, then either ‘m’ or ‘b’, indicating if the participant was brought up monolingually or bilingually.</p>
<p>There is an R script for collating and analysing the data in <code>analysis/R/analyseData.Rmd</code>, and this writes the results to <code>results/MainResults.html</code>.</p>
<p>I’m the owner of the project, which means I make all the decisions about how edits are done. This is me:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/me.png" />

</div>
<p>You’ll be a contributor, this is what you look like:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/you.png" />

</div>
<p>If the repository is public, you don’t need permission to download the repository nor to make changes. But I’m the only one who can merge your changes into the main project. (Actually, “collaborators” can also do this, but that’s another issue).</p>
<h3 id="overview"><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Overview</h3>
<p>Let’s say you’d like make changes to the project. We’ll take the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fork</strong> the master GitHub repository</li>
<li><strong>Clone</strong> the forked repository onto our local system</li>
<li>Make a new <strong>branch</strong> of the project</li>
<li>Edit the branch to make our changes</li>
<li>Add and commit our changes</li>
<li>Make a pull request to the master repository</li>
<li>The owner then accepts the request and merges your changes into the master project</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="forking-a-github-repository"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Forking a GitHub repository</h2>
<p>Go to github.com and sign in.</p>
<p>Got to (https://github.com/seannyD/SeansGitHubTutorial-Collaboration)[https://github.com/seannyD/SeansGitHubTutorial-Collaboration]</p>
<p>Click on the “Fork” button in the top right corner. This will make a copy of the project <em>on the github server</em> (not your local machine).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Fork.png" />

</div>
<p>After a few moments, you’ll have a new page which shows your forked repository.</p>
<p>Note that the top left of the screen tells you it’s a fork:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/ForkedScreen.png" />

</div>
<p>If you were to go back to your GitHub homepage, you’d see a tab on the right looking like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/ForkedScreenHome.png" />

</div>
<p>Note the little ‘fork’ symbol next to the project name.</p>
<p>This is now <em>your</em> project. But GitHub knows that it’s a copy of another project, and it’ll do some smart things later to help us merge changes.</p>
<h3 id="clone-the-forked-repository"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Clone the forked repository</h3>
<p>Next we need to find the URL of the repository. Go to your GitHub fork page and find the “clone” button:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/cloneButton.png" />

</div>
<p>Click it and a little box will appear with a link. Copy this link (make sure the link starts with “https”).</p>
<p>Make another folder for this collaboration tutorial. Make sure it is <strong>not inside the folder for the previous tutorial</strong>, or inside any other folder which already has a github repository.</p>
<p>Navigate to this folder in your terminal / GitBash. For me it’s something like:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cd ~/Documents/Teaching/IntroToGitHub/TutorialFolders/collaborationTutorial</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s clone the repository. In your terminal, type</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git clone https://github.com/seannyD/SeansGitHubTutorial-Collaboration.git</code></pre>
<p>You should see output like this:</p>
<pre><code>Cloning into &#39;SeansGitHubTutorial-Collaboration&#39;...
remote: Counting objects: 26, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (20/20), done.
remote: Total 26 (delta 3), reused 26 (delta 3), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (26/26), done.
Checking connectivity... done.</code></pre>
<p>Git should now download both the files and the repository structure to your machine. You should have a folder inside your working directory named <code>SeansGitHubTutorial-Collaboration</code>.</p>
<p>Navigate inside this folder:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cd SeansGitHubTutorial-Collaboration</code></pre>
<p>We can now look at the commits:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git log --oneline

<p>There are lots of commits! In fact, more than can be displayed in the terminal at one time. You can press ‘Enter’ to scroll through the rest of the commits, or press ‘q’ to get back to the command prompt.</p>
<h2 id="branching"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Branching</h2>
<p>We’re now going to edit our local version of the project, then upload our edits to the main project. Because other people might be working on this project at the same time, we want to work on a <strong>branch</strong>.</p>
<p>The idea is that people can work on their own branches independently, then <strong>merge</strong> the branches into the master branch later.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/BranchingAndMerging.png" />

</div>
<p>Let’s check which branch we’re on:</p>
<pre>
> git branch 
<span style="color:lightgreen">* master</span> 
</pre>
<p>This repository only has one brach - the master branch - and that’s our currently checked-out branch (you can tell by the * symbol).</p>
<p>Now we can make our own branch to work on. I’m going to call my branch “SeanAddData”, but you should name it something so that it’s clear what’s going on in this branch.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git branch SeanAddData</code></pre>
<p>Let’s check the branches again:</p>
<pre>
> git branch 
    SeanAddData
  <span style="color:lightgreen">* master</span> 
</pre>
<p>There are now two branches, but the master banch is still the checked-out one.</p>
<p>Let’s checkout our branch (remember, your branch name will be different):</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git checkout SeanAddData
Switched to branch &#39;SeanAddData&#39;</code></pre>
<h2 id="making-changes"><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Making changes</h2>
<p>We can now make changes as before, but now safely on your own branch.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, make a new text file and list in it as many animals as you can in 30 seconds.</p>
<p><strong><em>Add your own response file</em></strong> to data/rawData/animals/. Make sure there’s one response per line, and that you name file something like “YourName_m.txt” (where m is monolingual and b is bilingual).</p>
<p><strong><em>Add your changes to the repository branch</em></strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt; git add *</code></pre>
<p><strong><em>Commit your changes</em></strong>, adding a commit message that makes sense:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git commit -m &quot;Added data from &lt;Your name&gt;&quot;</code></pre>
<h3 id="pushing-the-branch-back-to-github"><span class="header-section-number">3.5.1</span> Pushing the branch back to GitHub</h3>
<p><strong><em>Push your branch to the GitHub repository</em></strong>. The first time we do this, we need to tell git that we want the ‘upstream’ branch to be the GitHub branch (the ‘origin’).</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git push --set-upstream origin &lt;Your branch name&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You should get output like this:</p>
<pre><code>Counting objects: 6, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Writing objects: 100% (6/6), 647 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 6 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/seannyD/SeansGitHubTutorial-Collaboration.git
 * [new branch]      SeanAddData -&gt; SeanAddData
Branch SeanAddData set up to track remote branch SeanAddData from origin.</code></pre>
<h2 id="making-a-pull-request"><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Making a pull request</h2>
<p>If we go back to your fork project on the GitHub website, we now see two things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>that the project has one more branch, and that the latest commit was a few seconds ago, with the commit message you made.</li>
<li>There’s a button labelled “Compare and Pull request”</li>
</ol>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/BranchAdded.png" />

</div>
<p>Click on “Compare and Pull request”. You’ll get a page like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/PullRequest.png" />

</div>
<p>You can add a title to your pull request, and even write a comment. When you’re collaborating with lots of people, this is very useful. You can describe your change in detail, and argue why your change should become part of the main project. Later on, GitHub offers a forum for people to discuss this.</p>
<p>Fill in a message and click “Create pull request”.</p>
<p>Now a message is sent to me, the owner, that you’ve made a request. This is what I see on my GitHub homepage:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/OwnerNotified.png" />

</div>
<p>I click on the link, and I get a summary of the changes you made. I then get two options:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/OwnerOptions.png" />

</div>
<p>The first tells me there are no conflicts between our versions, so I can “Merge pull request”. Or I can add a comment that will be sent to you, perhaps explaining why this shouldn’t be added, asking for clarification or asking for a particular change.</p>
<p>I click “Merge pull request” (and I get a chance to add my own comment which will become part of a commit message).</p>
<p>After I’ve confirmed the merge, your changes will show up on the main project page (not just your fork). Your changes are now part of the master branch!</p>
<h3 id="updaing-your-local-copy"><span class="header-section-number">3.6.1</span> Updaing your local copy</h3>
<p>You made changes and I merged them into the master project, but you don’t have the most up to date version yet on your local machine. So you should pull the changes from the server. You can pull changes at any time, even if you don’t intend to merge branches.</p>
<p>First, let’s <strong>make sure we’ve switched back to the master branch</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git branch master</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s <strong>pull</strong> new data from GitHub (this is the opposite of <strong>push</strong>).</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git pull

remote: Counting objects: 6, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Total 6 (delta 1), reused 6 (delta 1), pack-reused 0

<h2 id="viewing-other-peoples-changes"><span class="header-section-number">3.7</span> Viewing other people’s changes</h2>
<p>When you pull updates from GitHub, you’ll probably want to know what’s changed. First, let’s see what the commit messages are like:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git log --oneline

2a06936 edited readme
e3380a9 Add data from Sean
b595bad Add processed data file
d4d7a4f Added raw data and first analysis script
26bf47a first commit</code></pre>
<p>Let’s say we want to find out what happened between “Add data from Sean” and “edited readme”. We can use <code>git diff</code> followed by the two commit IDs we want to compare.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git diff e3380a9 2a06936</code></pre>
<p>This gives the following output:</p>
<pre>
<b>diff --git a/README.md b/README.md

</pre>
<p>This means that there were edits to <strong>README.md</strong>. The line at the start of the file “# Collaboration tutorial# SeansGitHubTutorial-Collaboration”, was deleted and several other lines were added. Basically, the last edit just updated the README file to include a fuller description.</p>
<h3 id="merging-branches-in-your-local-project"><span class="header-section-number">3.7.1</span> Merging branches in your local project</h3>
<p>In the example above, the collaborators made branches, then the project owner merged them. But you can merge branches in your own local repository. You can use <code>merge</code> in the same way as above:</p>
<p>Make sure you’re in the branch you want to merge <em>into</em> (e.g. the master branch:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git branch master</code></pre>
<p>Then merge the branches</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git merge NameOfBranchToMerge</code></pre>
<h2 id="review"><span class="header-section-number">3.8</span> Review</h2>
<p>In this tutorial we learned how to <em>fork</em> a GitHub repository. We can then <em>clone</em> that fork to our local machine using:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git clone &lt;web address of fork&gt;</code></pre>
<p>We also learned commands to view branches:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git branch </code></pre>
<p>… create new branches:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git branch newBranchName</code></pre>
<p>… switch branches:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git branch nameOfBranchToSwitchTo</code></pre>
<p>We learned that, if you’re collaborating, development should always be done on a branch, not the master. We can make changes to our local branch with <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code> as before. We can push our branch to the GitHub page with <code>git push</code>. When we’re done, we can push our project to our fork page, then make a <strong>pull request</strong>. If the owner of the project accepts the request, our changes will become part of the master project.</p>
<p>If we want, we can merge branches on our local machine:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git merge branchToMergeFrom</code></pre>
<h2 id="appliations-in-linguistics"><span class="header-section-number">3.9</span> Appliations in linguistics</h2>
<p>The Glottolog database is a database of the world’s languages, classified into families and sub-families: <a href="http://glottolog.org/" class="uri">http://glottolog.org/</a>.</p>
<p>It’s edited and maintained through GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/clld/glottolog-data" class="uri">https://github.com/clld/glottolog-data</a>.</p>
<p>This means you can fork this repository, clone it to your machine, make changes (e.g. add a new language, or change what family a language belongs to), then make a pull request. The owners of glottolog will discuss your change, and may accept it. Your change will then be reflected on the glottolog website and in the database. You can change the course of linguistic history!</p>
<p>The GitHub webpage for Glottolog is also a place where people can raise issues, even if they’re not familiar with git. Here’s some recent issues being discussed:</p>
